# RickRollJS

This is a simple script that integrates a RickRoll anywhere that accepts HTML and JavaScript, it's prepared to be an 'include and run' script with some references to videogames because why not?

To use, ypu can clone the project, download the file or even link the file from https://saleck3.github.io/RickRollJS/WheneverYouNeedSomebody.js (Thanks github!!!)

To use a different trigger or to set a message, add it as a parameter in the HTML

E.g.:

`<script src="WheneverYouNeedSomebody.js" id="SomethingSpecial" trigger="asdf" bait="If you're from Konami & see this, please do not sue us for the easter egg"></script>`

-   id="SomethingSpecial" (required for special message/trigger)
-   trigger="asdf" Set the key press for the trigger
-   bait="asdf" Set a message to show in console
