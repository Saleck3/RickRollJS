# RickRollJS
This is a simple script that integrates a RickRoll anywhere that accepts HTML and JavaScript, it's prepared to be an 'include and run' script with some references to videogames because why not?

To use, ypu can clone the project, download the file or even link the file from https://saleck3.github.io/RickRollJS/WheneverYouNeedSomebody.js (Thanks github!!!)
